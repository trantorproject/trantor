# trantor-ai

Access to LLM providers behind one contract. This is the model layer: one call, one answer. Agents,
tools loops and runs are built on top of it, not here.

---

## Registering it

```kotlin
services.addAI()
```

That brings the `ModelRegistry` and the providers Trantor ships with. Middlewares are named by the
application, never collected from the container:

```kotlin
services.addAI { models, _ -> models.use(RetryMiddleware()) }
```

A provider's settings come from its own config section, and can be adjusted in code:

```kotlin
services.addOpenAI { openAI, services -> openAI.apiKey = services.config.required("openai.apikey") }
```

The order of `addAI` and `addOpenAI` does not matter. Both are idempotent.

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "providers": { "openai": { "baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/v1" } },
    "models": { "default": "openai/gpt-4.1-mini", "smart": "openai/o4-mini" }
  }
}
```

The api key is **not** in the configuration file. It comes from `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and if it is missing the
failure happens on the first call, with a message saying what to set — not at startup, so an application
that never calls OpenAI never needs the key.

---

## Getting a model

```kotlin
val models = services.get<ModelRegistry>()

models.chat()                          // the "default" alias
models.chat("smart")                   // another alias from ai.models
models.chat("openai/gpt-4.1-nano")     // straight at a provider and model
```

An alias can point at another alias; a cycle is an error that names the chain. A reference to a provider
nobody registered is a `ModelNotFoundError` that lists the ones that are.

Resolved models are cached, and the cache is dropped whenever a provider, alias or middleware is added.

---

## Calling one

```kotlin
val response = models.chat().generate("Hola") { temperature = 0.2 }

println(response.text)
println(response.usage)
```

The shortcut above is an extension over the two methods every adapter implements. The full form is a
`ChatRequest`:

```kotlin
val response = models.chat().generate(
    ChatRequest(Message.system("Respondé en castellano"), Message.user("Hola")),
    CallOptions(timeout = 30.seconds),
)
```

```kotlin
models.chat().stream("Contame un cuento").use { stream ->
    for (part in stream) {
        when (part) {
            is StreamPart.TextDelta -> print(part.text)
            is StreamPart.ReasoningDelta -> { }
            else -> { }
        }
    }

    val response = stream.response()
}
```

`ChatRequest` carries what the call is about: `messages`, `tools`, `toolChoice`, `output`, `settings` and
`providerOptions`. `ChatSettings` holds the knobs — `temperature`, `maxOutputTokens`, `seed`, `reasoning`,
`failOnWarnings`. `CallOptions` is about the call and not the content: `timeout`, `cancellation`, `headers`.

A `ChatResponse` has `content` (a list of `Part`), `finishReason`, `usage`, `info` and `warnings`.

---

## The shapes

**Naming**: a name shared across model families carries no prefix — `CallOptions`, `Usage`,
`ResponseInfo`, `ModelWarning`. A name that belongs to chat carries it — `ChatModel`, `ChatRequest`,
`ChatResponse`, `ChatStream`.

**Parts**: `TextPart`, `ReasoningPart`, `ToolCallPart`, `ToolResultPart`, `RefusalPart`, and
`ProviderPart` for anything the adapter did not recognize. A `ProviderPart` carries the original payload
and goes back where it came from, so a field the provider added is visible instead of lost.

**Warnings, not silence.** When a request asks for something the provider cannot do, the response carries
a `ModelWarning`. `failOnWarnings` turns those into an error for an application that would rather stop.

---

## Structured output

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class Invoice(val number: String, val total: Double)

val response = models.chat().generate(
    ChatRequest(listOf(Message.user("Extraé los datos")), output = OutputSpec.json<Invoice>()),
)

val invoice = response.objectAs<Invoice>()
```

The schema is generated from the Kotlin class. OpenAI's strict mode has rules the generator enforces —
every property required, no open maps — and what cannot be expressed comes back as a warning.

---

## Tools

```kotlin
val weather = FunctionToolSpec(
    name = "get_weather",
    description = "The weather in a city",
    parameters = JsonSchemas.of<WeatherQuery>(),
)

val response = models.chat().generate(
    ChatRequest(listOf(Message.user("¿Llueve en Bariloche?")), tools = listOf(weather)),
)

response.toolCalls.forEach { ... }
```

`ToolSpec` has two shapes: `FunctionToolSpec` for a tool the application runs, and `ProviderToolSpec` for
one the provider runs on its side.

The model layer **does not run tools**. It reports the calls the model asked for and sends back the
results it is given. Running them is the agent layer's job.

---

## Reasoning

```kotlin
models.chat("smart").generate("Resolvé esto") {
    reasoning = Reasoning.effort(ReasoningEfforts.High, ReasoningSummaries.Auto)
}
```

Providers take either an effort level or a token budget, so there is `Reasoning.effort(...)` and
`Reasoning.budget(...)`, and an adapter warns when it gets the form it does not understand.

Reasoning content the provider will not show comes back as an opaque `ReasoningPart`, which is passed
back on the next turn so the model keeps its own chain. Not every model takes every effort level; one
that does not produces a provider error naming the parameter.

---

## Middlewares

`ChatModelMiddleware` wraps any model, with `transform`, `generate` and `stream`:

```kotlin
models.use(RetryMiddleware())
```

`RetryMiddleware` tries again only when the provider said the problem was temporary — a rate limit, a
5xx, a timeout, a broken connection. A bad key, a rejected request or a body that did not parse fails on
the first try. The call's `timeout` is a **deadline for the whole thing**, not for each attempt, and each
attempt gets what is left. A stream is reopened only while nothing has reached the caller.

Middlewares wrap in the order they were named.

---

## Providers

An adapter implements `AIProvider` and adds itself to the `ModelRegistry` through `configure<ModelRegistry>`,
so an application that never asks for it never pays for it.

Provider specifics that do not fit the contract travel in `ChatRequest.providerOptions` and come back in
`providerMetadata`. Each adapter reads only its own and warns about the rest. Options are merged into the
request body recursively: adding a field next to one the
adapter already set works, and a real conflict is an `InvalidProviderOptionError` naming the full path.

Currently: **OpenAI**, on the Responses API.

---

## Cancellation

```kotlin
val cancellation = Cancellation()

models.chat().generate(request, CallOptions(cancellation = cancellation))
```

Cancelling closes the connection. Because the transport reports that as an end of data rather than an
error, what was read is checked afterwards: half an answer is a `CancelledError`, never an answer. The
listener is registered before the call is opened, since that wait is itself cancellable, and removed when
the call ends, so a token reused across calls does not accumulate callbacks.
